# savvy-progress

A Claude Code mod: a progress bar above the prompt and a live panel of subagents. Made for the [savvy-flow](../savvy-flow) skill, and useful with any subagents.

- **Progress bar**: the flow's title, phase, accepted tasks out of planned, and a button with the crew size that opens the panel. It appears once something reports progress (savvy-flow does) or a `savvy-*` worker starts.
- **Agents panel** (`/agents-info` toggles it): running, finished and planned subagents with model, effort, task progress, context, estimated cost and time. Working crabs walk, and each savvy tier animates its prop: the astronaut floats, the detective sweeps the magnifier, the engineer turns the wrench, the chef tosses the omelette, the racer runs with a fluttering flag. `prefers-reduced-motion` stops them.

## Tools it adds

- `mcp__savvy-progress__progress`: the orchestrator reports the plan, phase and accepted tasks.
- `mcp__savvy-progress__step`: a worker reports its own steps (`done`, `total`, `note`). A worker that does not report shows its context fill in grey instead.

Cost is a rough estimate from token counts and a built-in per-model price table (`PRICES` in `hooks/register.tsx`), not a bill.

## Attention flags

A worker can ask for help through `step`:

- `failed: true` counts one failed attempt (test gate red, fix rejected, build broken). Three or more flag the card **FAILED ×N** until a step call reports the task done.
- `blocked: "<question>"` flags the card **NEEDS INPUT** and shows the question under it; the worker's next `step` call without `blocked` clears it.

A flagged card gets a static red label in the full and compact panel, the band above the prompt shows a red **⚠ N need attention** chip (even with no flow running), and a toast fires once per new reason: a new question, or reaching FAILED ×3. Any subagent spawn opens the panel (once per flow).

## Settings

`language`: `auto` (default), `en` or `ru`. `auto` follows Claude Code's `language` setting, then the system locale, and falls back to English. Set it in `/config`, or, for a mod loaded by hand, in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "pluginConfigs": { "savvy-progress": { "options": { "language": "ru" } } } }
```

Install instructions are in the [repository README](../../README.md).
